### Overview
Repurposing content involves taking existing assets and modifying them to create new content formats suitable for various platforms. It is the process of reusing content in a new way so that you can continue reaping its benefits. Instead of constantly creating fresh content from scratch, marketers should look at what they already have, such as top-performing blog posts, videos, reports, white papers, and more, and repurpose them. The goal is to maximize the value of the original content and extend its reach across different channels.

### Key Concepts
- **Evergreen Content:** Content that contains information that remains valid over time and only needs small tweaks to remain fresh. It is not time-sensitive and can be easily updated and transformed into various formats without losing value.
- **High-Performing Content:** Content that has already proven valuable to your audience and performs well in terms of metrics like website visits, lead generation, brand awareness, likes, shares, comments, mentions, or click-through rate. It provides a strong foundation for repurposing success.
- **Hero Content (Macro/Long-Form):** A piece of content that is bigger or longer in nature, such as a YouTube video, podcast, newsletter, or blog post. This long-form content serves as the foundation from which many smaller pieces of content can be extracted and repurposed.
- **Tailoring Content:** Adapting repurposed content for each specific channel to ensure it resonates with the audience's format preferences, platform requirements, and unique style. Avoid simply reposting content verbatim.
- **Share of Voice:** A metric indicating how much your brand dominates a conversation in your industry compared to competitors. Repurposing content allows brands to maintain steady content production volume to maintain and grow share of voice without creating a bunch of new content.
- **Content Licensing:** Reusing or republishing articles and photographs from reputable publications through copyright licenses. It allows organizations to repurpose content written by industry experts without wasting valuable resources, enhancing brand authority and establishing thought leadership.
**Content Repurposing:** The process of adapting existing content into different formats and distributing it across various platforms.
**Content Repurposing Workflow/System:** A structured approach involving planning, content selection, adaptation, distribution, and measurement to consistently repurpose content effectively.
**Format Cascade:** Mapping out how a core asset will be transformed and distributed across various channels and formats early in the planning process.
**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Specific metrics used to track the success of repurposed content on different platforms (e.g., click-through rates, engagement, watch time).
**Multi-touch Attribution:** Analyzing how different pieces of repurposed content contribute to the customer journey.


### General Benefits of Repurposing
- **Saves time, money, and effort** required for content creation. It allows brands to make the most out of every marketing resource.

- **Reinforces brand message** by communicating key messages more broadly across different platforms and formats.

- **Maximizes value** of existing content assets.

### Choosing Content to Repurpose
- **Know your purpose and goals:** Select content that aligns with current marketing goals, such as raising brand awareness, connecting with your audience, driving organic traffic, or supporting leads.

- **Identify evergreen content:** Focus on content that remains relevant over time, such as how-to guides, comprehensive blog posts, or ultimate guides.
